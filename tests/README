# TODO: add tests. I don't think we can do it in a nice way.
# my bet is that we will need to use expect ( http://expect.sourceforge.net/ )
# or something similar

# there must never be a difference between running a command with enabled
# and disabled commash when debugger is off

# be able to touch and rm files in pipes
touch a | touch b | touch c
rm a | rm b | rm c


#-----------
# safe mode
- rm (instead of delete, just put it into trash)
- cp
- mv
- cp+mv (don't rewrite anything, just put it into trash)
- chmod (explain what will happen)


- create a trash for "deleted files" and log files "for edited files (chmod)

#---------
# debug mode
- be able to run partial command
- show ast?


#----------
# show rc
- show rc after ctrl+c
- show rc other than 0 after every executed command (even from debugger)
